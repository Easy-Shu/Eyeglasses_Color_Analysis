# Eyeglasses_Color_Analysis
This research pioneers a hierarchical model to understand children's color perception in eyeglasses design. Previous studies have mainly focused on shape and size, neglecting the significance of color. We bridge this gap by examining the relationship between subjective emotional responses and objective color values in children's eyeglasses design.
